# Readme

The jupyter notebook [ImageClass.ipynb](./ImageClass.ipynb) contains the code for the paper submitted for Deep Learning Assignment 2, it contains the models AlexNet, ResNet101, ResNet18, VGGNet11 and GoogLenet as well as a baseline model (named myCNN). Each of the 6 models have been trained using the optimizers SGD, Adam and RAdam, futher ResNet18, ResNet101 and GoogLeNet have been trained for both learning rates 0.01 and 0.0001, so in total it contains a total of 27 models.

The meta data colleccted for all these models are stored in [model_meta.json](./model_meta.json), this was used to plot the graphs and draw conclusions. As well as get the outputs that are easily understood by even laymen.
