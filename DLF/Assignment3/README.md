The jupyter notebook [StockPricePredictionMultivariate.ipynb](./StockPricePredictionMultivariate.ipynb) contains the code for Multivariate Analysis and  [StockPricePredictionUnivariate.ipynb](./StockPricePredictionUnivariate.ipynb) contains the code for Univariate Analysis for the paper submitted for Deep Learning Assignment 3, it contains the models RNN, LSTM, and GRU. Each with and without Dropout layers to observe the performance on adding the layer. 

The losses have been collected for all these models are stored in [Model Comparison.xlsx](./Model%20Comparison.xlsx), this was used to determine the best model on each scenario.
